Project: Work Done Tracker

It helps you track your progress by remembering how many hours you worked today, over months and years.

Inspired by a lesson from Ikigai that says moving or standing after every 30mins of uninterrupted sitting increases your lifespan.

Will add analytics as I learn more over time.
